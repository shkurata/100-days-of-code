### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on my portfolio website. Added some content in the About me section, added a contact form and worked on the navigation layout.

**Thoughts:** I tried to use the flexbox layout for my contact form's responsiveness, but √è didn't achieved what I wanted. For now I leaving it like this.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** My contact form works now. I didn't expect this to take me so much time. I refactored the images that I use. I made them smaller for faster loading of my page.

**Thoughts:** Making a contact form to send email without PHP was a little tricky, but I'm glad that I found an elegant solution. I really need to finish this portfolio website.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I added some texts to my portfolio website, changed the font and added a footer with social icons.

**Thoughts:** I'm near the end. Maybe it should be better to use Bootstrap
