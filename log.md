Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my portfolio website. Added some content in the About me section, added a contact form and worked on the navigation layout.

**Thoughts:** I tried to use the flexbox layout for my contact form's responsiveness, but √è didn't achieved what I wanted. For now I leaving it like this.
